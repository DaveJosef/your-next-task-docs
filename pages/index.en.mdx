You can add a task to the task list by clicking <AddBtn alt="Botão de Adicionar Tarefa" src={addBtnImg.src} />

The name inserted into the field of same panel will be associated to the name of the new task added to the list.
The task list works as a queue, model in which the last task inserted will be located at the end of the list.

## ✔ Update Task

Once added to the list, in the case you have informed the wrong name to certain task, it will not be necessary to delete it: just click the update task icon <InlineImg alt="Ícone de Atualizar Tarefa" src={updateBtnImg.src} />

An update task modal will show up.
