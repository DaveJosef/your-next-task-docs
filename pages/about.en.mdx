# ✔ About

Your Next Task is a NextJS Personal Project created by [José (Dave) David](https://github.com/DaveJosef).
The project was created as a means of studying NextJS and its features. I also opted for following the **Glassmorphism** Trend.

The project counts on:
- ✔ TDD (Test Driven Development);
- ✔ Redux (States Centralization);
- ✔ Styled Components.
